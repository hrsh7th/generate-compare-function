# generate-compare-function
generate compare function by object paths.

# Note
-I created this package.-

-I hope `generate-compare-function` is faster than `select with shallow-equals`.-

-But real results is no my hopeness ðŸ˜­.-

-So we dont need this package.-

Sorry, my benchmark script had bug.
I solved this bug, so that made my hoped results.
this package is maybe useful someone!

```bash
$ npm run perf

> generate-compare-function@0.0.0 perf /path/to/generate-compare-function
> ts-node ./perf/perf.ts

generate-compare-function x 211,816,366 ops/sec Â±1.49% (90 runs sampled)
select function with shallow equals. x 9,756,988 ops/sec Â±0.91% (92 runs sampled)
Fastest is generate-compare-function
```

# Usage

### generate compare function.
```ts
import { generateCompareFunction } from 'generate-compare-function';

const compare = generateCompareFunction([
  ['path', 'to', 'value1'],
  ['path', 'to', 'value2'] // it is not using in this senario. but below senarios works well.
]);
```

### use compare function.
```ts
const baseObject = {
  path: {
    to: {
      value1: true
    }
  }
};

const differentObjectAsBase = {
  path: {
    to: {
      value1: false
    }
  }
};

const sameObjectAsBase = {
  path: {
    to: {
      value1: true
    }
  }
};

// true, if passing same object.
expect(compare(baseObject, baseObject)).toBe(true);

// false, if passing different objects thats are not have same value in path to compare.
expect(compare(baseObject, differentObjectAsBase)).toBe(false);

// true, if passing different objects thats are have same value in path to compare.
expect(compare(baseObject, sameObjectAsBase)).toBe(true);
```
